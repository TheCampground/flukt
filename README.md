# Flukt - Kotlin SDK for Fluxer

Flukt is designed from scratch to work with Fluxer. There is still a lot, LOT to be done. Primarily I will use this SDK in my upcoming mobile app for fluxer. 

A tentative list of issues will be published soon, as well as a public roadmap. Currently this is little more than an API wrapper. I ask you to please be patient, I'm a full time university student with limited time.
